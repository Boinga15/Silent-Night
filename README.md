# Silent-Night
A slow stealth game where survival against all odds is the only way to win. Based on "Contact A-888".

Silent Night is a stealth game that puts you in control of three seperate characters in a hostile area. The maze and world you explore is randomly generated, so you'll have to be ready for anything. Collect resources to heal your team and also upgrade their capabilities. Your objective is to find a way to cull the invasion, and you've only got one chance at that.

If the game is too easy, a Hazard Level setting exists to allow you to up the difficulty of the game, from mildly difficult to practically impossible.
